# 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Oleh** – a Computer Science student at **Kent State University**.

🔧 I’m currently learning and building in:
- 🎮 **Game programming** (Godot, Unity, modding tools)
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity** (reverse engineering, exploits, systems)
- 💻 **C#**, **C++**, **Python**, and exploring **GDScript**
- ⚙️ Linux (Pop!_OS / Debian), Windows 10 (main OS), Git, and home server setups

Outside of tech, I’m into music, horror movies, electronics, and weird audio experiments.

🛒 I also work part-time in retail while leveling up my dev skills.

# 🧠 Current Focus
- Learning **Object-Oriented Programming** (freeCodeCamp + university)
- Writing tools/scripts in **Python**, **C#** and **C++**
- Building game prototypes in **Godot Engine**
- Studying **networking, exploits, and system security**

# 🛠 Projects

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fernwick** | A surreal, narrative-driven fantasy game about a lazy wizard caught in post-revolution chaos *(in development)* |
| **In the Name of Sabbath** | Southern Gothic survival horror set in a mythic, decaying swamp world – inspired by sludge metal, folklore, and cults *(concept stage)* |
| **Home Server Project** | Custom home server built on an old laptop running **Debian 12** – includes **Samba file sharing**, CLI tools, and planned additions like Docker. Great for learning sysadmin basics, bash scripting, and troubleshooting real hardware. |

> ✨ More projects coming soon – currently balancing school, work, and solo dev time.

# 📂 Home Server Setup (Details)

A personal project to learn Linux and home networking using an old laptop:

- OS: **Debian 12**
- Services: **Samba**, SSH access, and utility scripts
- Configs: Mounted drives, file permissions, CLI navigation
- Why: To learn system maintenance, service management, and Linux-based file sharing

> 💡 Cleaned and sanitized config samples available soon in separate repo
